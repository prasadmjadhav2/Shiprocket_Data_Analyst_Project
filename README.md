## Conclusions
‚Ä¢ Order fulfillment and delivery efficiency need improvement, with nearly 49% of
orders being late.
‚Ä¢ Sales show seasonal trends, with certain months experiencing steep drops (e.g.,
February).
‚Ä¢ Returns are a major concern, with top products having a ~50% return rate.
‚Ä¢ Incomplete orders cause significant revenue loss, amounting to ‚Çπ76.6M.
‚Ä¢ South leads in sales and orders, followed closely by North and Central.
‚Ä¢ Payment preference is shifting towards digital methods, with UPI and Debit Cards
being most popular.
‚Ä¢ Organic and referral traffic drive the most revenue, making them key for marketing
focus.

## Final Key Takeaways & Business Actions
‚Ä¢ Reduce return rates by improving product quality and enforcing stricter return
policies.
‚Ä¢ Improve delivery efficiency through better vendor selection and AI-driven route
optimization.
‚Ä¢ Boost customer retention via loyalty programs, targeted discounts, and
subscriptions.
‚Ä¢ Leverage high-performing marketing channels (organic & referrals) to reduce paid
acquisition costs.
‚Ä¢ Increase prepaid transactions to minimize COD-related risks.
‚Ä¢ Analyze and optimize the discounting strategy for profitability instead of pure sales
volume.
‚Ä¢ Diversify product offerings to reduce over-reliance on a few best-sellers.

## üöö Shiprocket Machine Learning Project: Revolutionizing Courier & Logistics with AI üöö

Excited to share insights from my recent machine learning project, where I developed AI-driven predictive models for Shiprocket, optimizing delivery operations, return predictions, and dynamic pricing strategies for efficient logistics management.

### üìä Project Overview:

#### Objective: Predict order returns, estimate delivery times, and optimize shipping costs using AI-driven insights.
#### Dataset: 100,000 records, 26 features, including order details, pricing, delivery time, vendor ratings, stock availability, and customer ratings.

### üöÄ Key Solutions & Achievements:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Return Prediction Model (Binary Classification)
Built an XGBoost Classifier, achieving:
Training Accuracy: 80%
Testing Accuracy: 50%
Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance, improving return detection accuracy.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Delivery Time Prediction (Regression)
Developed a Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.51 days
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 16.34
Incorporated order details, region, vendor performance, and shipping costs into the model for precise delivery estimates.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Pricing Optimization (Regression)
Trained a CatBoost Regressor, reducing RMSE to 565.76, providing data-driven pricing strategies for shipments.
Integrated units ordered, shipping costs, and promotional discounts to suggest optimal pricing.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Order Status Classification (Multi-Class Prediction)
Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether an order would be delivered, canceled, returned, or pending.
Achieved classification accuracy of 50% after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Explainability
Engineered features from traffic sources, payment methods, and vendor ratings to improve model performance.
Used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to interpret key drivers behind order returns and delays.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Readiness
Packaged final models into deployable Pickle (.pkl) files, enabling real-time logistics predictions.
Designed an interactive prediction system for estimating order status, delivery times, and return probabilities.

### üìà Results & Business Impact:
#### ‚úÖ Reduced Operational Delays: Accurate delivery time estimates enable better logistics planning.
#### ‚úÖ Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Minimized unexpected delays and returns through predictive analytics.
#### ‚úÖ Optimized Pricing Strategies: AI-driven pricing suggestions improve profitability and competitiveness.

### üöÄ This project highlights how AI and data science are revolutionizing the logistics and e-commerce sectors, making supply chains smarter, faster, and more cost-efficient.

#### üîó Let‚Äôs connect to discuss AI-driven logistics optimization!
